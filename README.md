##### This is a fast brief for ***fundamentals of a good developer***

###### the ***main*** two key points for developersis is:
##### 1. make the design be easy for you 
##### 2. make the design helpful for others.
> so it must be simple and trying to reduce complexity as much its possible, and working on the best practice way so Donâ€™t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.
